# USACO Solutions Folder Structure

This folder contains my solutions to USACO problems.

## Folder structure

- Each folder name corresponds to the name of the problem (or a shortened form).
- Each folder contains a `.py` file with the same name as the folder; this is my solution code.
- Some folders include `.in` and `.out` files, which are the input and output for the problem (used for testing on certain USACO problems).

Feel free to explore the solutions and input/output files to understand my approach to each problem.
